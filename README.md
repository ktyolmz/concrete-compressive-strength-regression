This project was done as the final project of the "Supervised Machine Learning: Regression" course given by IBM on Coursera. 

I finished this course with Honours degree. [Click here](https://coursera.org/verify/8F8YLGBDTLTZ) to view the certificate.

The dataset for his project is the [Concrete Compressive Strength](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/165/concrete+compressive+strength) dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/). It is a popular dataset used in machine learning and statistical analysis. It contains information about various factors affecting the compressive strength of concret, such as the composition of concrete ingredients (cement, water, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, etc.), age of concrete, and curing conditions. 


The target variable is typically the compressive strength of the concrete. The main objective of this project is to construct a model that accurately predicts the compressive strength of concrete based on the given features.
